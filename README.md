## Abstract

Chronic illnesses and ailments, such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and arthritis, are among the most frequent, expensive, and avoidable health issues. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that chronic diseases cause 7 out of every 10 deaths each year, and as of 2012, about half of all adults in the United States — 117 million individuals — had one or more chronic health conditions. Heart disease is causing an increase in mortality in today's health trend. By detecting heart illness on samples of health patient sources received from medical clinics, lives can be saved and fatalities reduced. As a follow-up, the relevant therapies must be instructed and recommended. One of the major elements anticipated for forecasting cardiac problems in advance is accuracy. Many approaches were studied and compared with few factors based on this aspect. We discovered and forecasted human heart illness using a range of machine learning algorithms and used the heart disease dataset to evaluate its performance using various metrics, according to the suggested study. We used Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks and Random forest. The approaches outlined in terms of their working theme and their adequacy are acknowledged.
